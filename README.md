# Quick Info !!
This is not yet the final version of my webpage. I am currently working on smaller improvements, such as localisation and an overhaul of the projects area (as I feel it is a bit too crammed) and am planning a pretty much full re-work of the website's design once I've gathered some good information. For now though, [enjoy it's current state!](https://tomasoleoni.herokuapp.com) ðŸ¤ 





# My portfolio website

### Why I made this

The purpose upon which this project was based, was to have a go-to website where one could find all necessary information about me from the perspective of an employer, co-workers or even just new people I get to know on a busiess oriented level.


### What I used to make this

This website is built on react using the create-react-app module and going from there. As I was not planning on integrating any sorts of backend operations, I decided not to include one in my project. Future integrations are however not to be discarded.
